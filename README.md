# M8070PatternToolbox: Keysight M8070 Digital Pattern Toolbox


## *Current version: 2023.05.02*

Frustrated after looking through hundreds of pages of user manuals to find out how to build a given data pattern for your Keysight BERT or AWG?

Need to convert your ADS bit pattern sequences in simulation to a ptrn file for your pattern generator or error detector?

Need to compare and create digital patterns?

Binary, PAM-4, PAM-3 all supported.


## **Try M8070PatternToolbox: a fast, free, and flexible way to create data patterns on the Keysight BERTS and AWGs.**

M8070PatternToolbox is a collection of Python classes and functions to read, write, and edit digital patterns.

## **Features**

* Read and write M8070 PTRN files
* Create PRBS sequences
* Encode and decode sequences



**testPatterns.py** is an example script 
**testPatterns_ADS_example.py** is a example script for porting over patterns into ADS
**testPatterns_awg_PRBS13Q.py** is an example for creating patterns for M819X AWGs in IQTools
**CreateIQTooslPRBS13Q.py** is an example of creating patterns for IQTools use

*M8070Pattern Toolbox was written for Python 3.8 and is not currently compatible with legacy Python 2.x*
